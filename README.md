## Workshop on Machine Learning and Deep Learning using Software-as-a-Service (via GoogleTM Colab)


### Workshop Abstract:
-----------------------
This workshop is designed to practically introduce students to the concept of concurrent systems with respect to Cloud Computing (as well as Virtual Computing). In this regard, our focus shall be on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), via Google^TM Colab, for accomplishing tasks related to Data Science. GoogleTM Colab is a free state-of-the-art SaaS resource comprising high-end computing (CPUs and GPUs) systems, software systems, storage systems, etc.; which can be employed for academic and/or research purposes. In this workshop, students will be introduced to GoogleTM Colab platform. Practically, we shall show and explain to the students how they can exploit GoogleTM cloud resources (precisely GoogleTM Colab) for compiling and executing their respective Machine Learning (ML) and/or Deep Learning (DL) source codes, which usually require high/huge computational resources. Also, the workshop shall explain the requirements necessary to operate GoogleTM Colab (SaaS) via remote connection. Thus, this workshop applies a practical-oriented content-delivery approach. The goals of this workshop shall be limited to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Cloud-Computing model. At the end of the workshop, students/participants shall receive a copy of the presentation.
